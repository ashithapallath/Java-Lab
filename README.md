## Introduction

This repository serves as a practical guide to learning and mastering Java. It includes solutions to problems and exercises, demonstrating Java’s key features and programming paradigms. It’s suitable for students, developers, and enthusiasts aiming to improve their understanding of Java programming.

## Topics Covered

The repository includes Java implementations and exercises for the following topics:

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.
2. **Basic Java Syntax**: Variables, data types, control flow (if-else, switch-case), loops (for, while).
3. **Exception Handling**: Try-catch blocks, custom exceptions, handling runtime errors.
4. **Data Structures**: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash maps.
5. **Algorithms**: Sorting (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort), searching (Binary Search, Linear Search), recursion.
6. **Multithreading**: Creating and managing threads, synchronization.
7. **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to files.
8. **GUI Programming**: Basics of Java Swing for creating graphical user interfaces.
